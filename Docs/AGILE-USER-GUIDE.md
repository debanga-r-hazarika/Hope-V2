# Agile Module – Simple How-To

This guide explains, in plain language, how to use the Agile module: what the screens mean, what each term means, and how to get work done.

## What you see
- **Board view (Kanban):** Columns for statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done). Cards are your work items.
- **Backlog view:** A list of all items with details (status, owner, priority, estimate, tags).
- **Roadmap view:** Buckets like Now / Next / Later that show how work is planned over time.
- **Top metrics:** Counts of items, total story points, number of statuses/buckets, and a simple progress bar.
- **Filters:** Limit what you see by status, owner, or tag.
- **Quick add (RW only):** Fast form to add a new work item.

## Key terms
- **Issue / Work item:** A task or story you need to do.
- **Status:** Where the item is in the flow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Priority:** How urgent it is. High (red), Normal (gray), Low (green).
- **Estimate (points):** Effort size; higher means more work.
- **Owner:** Who is responsible.
- **Tags:** Short labels to group or search (e.g., “frontend”, “bug”).
- **Roadmap bucket:** Time/phase grouping. Examples: Now (current), Next (upcoming), Later (future).
- **Drag & drop:** Move items between statuses to show progress.

## Access levels
- **Read & Write (RW):** Can create, edit, drag/drop, change priority, estimates, roadmap bucket, delete.
- **Read Only (RO):** Can view everything; cannot change or drag.
- **No Access:** Agile is hidden; direct links are blocked.

## How to do common things (RW users)
- **Create an item:** Use “Quick add” — enter title, pick status, priority, estimate (optional), owner (optional), tags (optional), description (optional). Click “Add Issue”.
- **Move work:** Drag a card to a different column. Dragging is disabled when filters are on (remove filters to drag).
- **Change priority:** On a card, use the priority dropdown (High/Normal/Low). High shows red.
- **Update estimate:** On a card or in the backlog list, edit the points field.
- **Assign owner:** Set owner in Quick add; later edits can be done via backlog table (owner field is displayed) or by editing via future detail views.
- **Set roadmap bucket:** On a card, pick a bucket (Now/Next/Later) to reflect planning.
- **Delete an item:** Use “Delete” on a card (board) or in the backlog row.
- **Refresh data:** Click “Refresh” in the header of the Agile page.

## Tips for RO users
- You can filter by status/owner/tag to find items.
- You can see priority colors, estimates, owners, and roadmap placement.
- You cannot drag or edit; if you need changes, ask someone with RW.

## Visual cues
- **Priority colors:** High (red), Normal (gray), Low (green).
- **Progress bar:** Shows percent of story points in “Done” (or similarly named) statuses.
- **Empty states:** Messages appear when no items match filters or a column is empty.

## When to use each view
- **Board:** Daily progress and standups; move items across statuses.
- **Backlog:** Review, sort, and clean up items; edit estimates and priority in a table.
- **Roadmap:** Communicate what’s planned Now/Next/Later; adjust buckets to plan ahead.

## Quick troubleshooting
- Can’t drag? Clear filters or ensure you have RW access.
- Missing Agile in the menu? You likely have No Access; ask an admin.
- Write actions failing? Your access might be RO; ask for RW if needed.
